## About Me  
I'm a Full Stack & System Developer with a passion for building efficient, scalable, and high-performance applications. With years of experience working on a diverse set of projects, I specialize in software development, backend systems, infrastructure automation, and low-level programming. I take pride in crafting well-designed and optimized systems that deliver real-world solutions.

I have a deep understanding of various programming languages and frameworks, which allows me to build and scale applications that are both robust and performant. Whether it's designing a backend API in **Node.js**, working with system-level code in **C** and **C++**, or orchestrating automated workflows, I love solving complex problems and creating software that makes a difference.

Some of my core values include:

- **Efficiency**: I am obsessed with optimizing code and ensuring that systems are as efficient as possible, both in terms of performance and resource usage.
- **Scalability**: I focus on building solutions that are not only effective for today but can also grow with the needs of tomorrow.
- **Collaboration**: While I enjoy diving into technical details, I also believe in the power of teamwork. I value open communication and feedback from peers to improve processes and outcomes.

Currently, I am working on **[Txtmax](https://github.com/Calestial2/Txtmax.git)**, a powerful text editor written in C

When I'm not developing software, I enjoy reading about new technological trends, experimenting with new tools, and enhancing my knowledge in the areas of **cloud computing**, **distributed systems**, and **data management**.

Feel free to reach out to me at **calestialashley@gmail.com** if you'd like to collaborate or talk about exciting new projects.

## What I'm Currently Exploring
- **Dart & Go**: Exploring these languages to extend my knowledge of backend development and distributed systems.
- **System Design**: Continuously honing my skills in designing high-performance, highly available systems that can handle millions of users.
